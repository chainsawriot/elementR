How to install elementR package from GitHub

For any platform: Check the version of the R software installed on your computer (must be at least â‰¥ 3.2.3, see https://cran.r-project.org/ for updating your version)

######## For Linux ########

1. Install and source "devtools" package from CRAN by running the following commands in your R console:

install.packages("devtools", dependencies = T)
library(devtools)

2. Install and source "elementR" package from GitHub by running the following commands in your R console:

install_github("charlottesirot/elementR", ref = "master", force = T, dependencies = T)
library(elementR)

######## For Mac OS ########

1. Check that XQuartz (https://www.xquartz.org/) is installed on your computer

2. Install and source "devtools" package from CRAN by running the following commands in your R console:

install.packages("devtools", dependencies = T)
library(devtools)

3. Install and source "elementR" package from GitHub by running the following commands in your R console:

install_github("charlottesirot/elementR", ref = "master", force = T, dependencies = T)
library(elementR)

Note: If the installation is stuck at the installation of the tcltk package, this probably means that XQuartz does not run properly. Check its validity.

1. Install and source "devtools" package from CRAN by running the following commands in your R console:

install.packages("devtools", dependencies = T)
library(devtools)

2. Install elementR's dependencies by running the following commands in your R console:

install.packages("miniCRAN", dependencies = T)
library(miniCRAN)

pkg <- c("gdata", "shiny","devtools", "shinyjs", "gnumeric", "R6", "shinydashboard", "abind", "stringr", "lmtest", "tcltk2", "reader", "readODS")
pkgToInstall <- pkgDep(pkg)
lapply(1:length(pkgToInstall), function(x){install.packages(pkgToInstall[x], dependencies = T)})
lapply(1:length(pkgToInstall), function(x){library(pkgToInstall[x])})

3. Install and source "elementR" package from GitHub by running the following commands in your R console:

ElementR runs on any web browser. However, as the graphic of the user interface has been developed based on Firefox, authors highly recommend to run elementR through this last web browser for an optimal design. Visit https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ to download Firefox.
